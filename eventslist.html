<ul>
    <li>October 11th, 2018: Garry removes almost all sub-subforums, and cuts down on the overall number of subforums. After some complaints he questions why he even keeps the forums up if everything is always supposedly his fault and that he and his company
        have nothing to gain from keeping the forums up. Additionally, he ponders deleting it all.</li>
    <li>October 11th, 2018: This website is made after Facepunch user Grenadiac makes a list of almost every site discord and their URLs / Invites so that in case the forums did get deleted, people would be able to communicate. I made this site to help keep
        the links alive in case it really did go tits up.</li>
