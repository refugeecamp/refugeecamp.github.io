<h3>If you're reading this then it's that time of the year again and Garry Newman of Facepunch studios has killed or nearly killed Facepunch Forums again. Don't be alarmed, there's a good chance it'll be back in a week. In the event of extended downtime or that Garry really has gone full tilted and killed it for good, please enjoy the following links and / or motivational content and may God help us all.</h3>
